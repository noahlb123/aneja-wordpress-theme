#I made a whole Wordpress theme for my professor before I realized themes can only be uploaded to premium accounts
Why does anyone use Wordpress?
Anyway I am putting it here so my work doesn't feel wasted.
If a thermodynamic miracle happens and someone wants to use this you can get the .zip file by doing:
```
npm install
npm run bundle
```
the .zip file will be generated in one directory up from where you executed this

Not that it matters but I made this using (_s)[https://github.com/automattic/_s]
